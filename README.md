PricePulse is an intuitive e-commerce price tracking web application. Its core function is to empower users by providing comprehensive insights into product pricing across multiple online retail platforms.

The application's primary feature allows users to input an Amazon product URL. Upon submission, PricePulse processes this URL to fetch the product's current pricing information. Beyond just the immediate price, the system is designed to build and display a historical price graph, offering users a visual representation of how the product's cost has fluctuated over time. This historical data is crucial for identifying trends, understanding price stability, and determining optimal purchase times.

A significant "bonus" feature of PricePulse is its cross-platform comparison capability. After tracking an Amazon product, the application intelligently searches for the same item on other popular e-commerce sites, such as Flipkart, Meesho, and BigBasket. It then presents the available prices from these alternative platforms, highlighting any discrepancies. This allows users to quickly compare prices from different retailers at a glance, ensuring they can find the best deal available.

The user interface is straightforward, featuring a prominent input field for the Amazon URL, a dedicated section for product preview (though actual product details are dynamically generated), a clear placeholder for the price history graph, and a well-organized list for cross-platform price comparisons. Built with React and styled using Bootstrap, PricePulse offers a responsive and user-friendly experience, making price tracking and comparison accessible to a wide audience. It serves as a valuable tool for savvy shoppers looking to optimize their online purchasing decisions.
